I"ê<p>Iâ€™m a software engineer focussed on data analytics. I have two years of experience developing scripts and programs with Python.</p>

<p>I graduated with a Masters in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from University of Pennsylvania. Here, I focussed on research in computational chemistry using Density Functional Theory applied to Li-ion batteries.</p>

<p>Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as a Process Engineer for Castrol. During my time, I was able to improve production capacity by 16.5% and reduce cost by 1 million INR through data driven analytics.
