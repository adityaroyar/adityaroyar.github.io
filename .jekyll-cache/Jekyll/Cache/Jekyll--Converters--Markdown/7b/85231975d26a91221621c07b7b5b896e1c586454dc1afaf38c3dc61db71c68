      <li>How many emails did I send during a given timeframe?</li>
      <li>At what times of the day do I send and receive emails with Gmail?</li>

<h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
<p>The data was obtained from https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout. Due to privacy reasons, the dataset is not included in this repository. After downloading the dataset containing all the emails, the compressed file was unzipped to obtain file with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.mbox</code> extension. In order to read this, the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mailbox/#description">mailbox library</a> was used. The following fields were extracted from the mailbox object -</p>
<ol>
  <li>Subject</li>
  <li>From</li>
  <li>Date</li>
  <li>To</li>
  <li>Label - Gmail treats labels as folders for the purposes of IMAP. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Thread - Gmail provides a thread ID to associate groups of messages in the same manner as in the Gmail web interface <sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="steps-prior-to-analysis">Steps prior to analysis</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Data cleaning - 
  1.1 Consisted of removing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NaN</code>
  1.2 Conversion of dataframe objects to a more suitable data format
  1.3 Extraction of email ids from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">from</code> field using regular expressions
  1.4 Dropping unneccessary columns</li>
  <li>Refactoring timezones -
  2.1 Done using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pytz</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pandas</code></li>
</ol>
